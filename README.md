# sds-documentation
This repository belongs to the Semantic Data Structuring Working Group (SDS WG) in the Open Manufacturing Platform. It contains content to generate a joint SDS WG documentation across different SDS WG repositories using Antora. 

We generate the website through GitHub actions and the result is available as GitHub Pages website at https://openmanufacturingplatform.github.io/sds-documentation/ .

As of now, the Antora build for the website pulls the content from the following repositories and sources:

- [SDS BAMM](https://github.com/OpenManufacturingPlatform/sds-bamm-aspect-meta-model/tree/main/src/docs)
- [SDS SDK](https://github.com/OpenManufacturingPlatform/sds-sdk/tree/main/documentation/developer-guide)
